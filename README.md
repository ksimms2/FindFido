# Green Print

## A profile to help determine the users carbon footprint and how to decrease it.

### App Name : Green Print

The functionality of this app will feature a profile of the user and a score of their carbon footprint. The user would then able to see their progression of decreasing their score by submitting daily/weekly tasks like using the air conditioner few days out of the year or riding their bicycle to work. The user would then be able to notify friends of their progress. 
This app will need some internet to access the API to process the initial survey, some updates and accessing a potential online community. But notifications could be sent using the app and most tips could be held within the app.
+ The survey will determine initial carbon footprint score. 
+ The User can submit daily/weekly tasks to decrease their carbon footprint.
Environmental forward users would find this app useful and help people understand their environmental impact.

## Current Development of GreenPrint

The current state of GreenPrint is running well, the user is able to switch between fragments, the survey allows for input which is applied to the overall score, the survey is able to save inputs in shared preferences, and the local database is saving footproint scores every time the survey is submitted.
### Unimplemented/Incomplete Elements of GreenPrint

+ Need update screen to have working checkboxes
+ Need update button to decrease score by appropriate amount and update the footprint score

### Known Issues/Bugs

+ Rotating screen returns to the home screen instead of staying on current screen
+ Rotating screen also seems to clear shared preferences.
+ Keyboard on survey covers some of the answer boxes as the screen auto-scrolls
+ When selecting from the menu, highlighted selection does not always correspond with current fragment 

## Android API version and Hardware

For this application, the following were used to test UI and function.
+ Android API 27
+ Nexus 5x emulator

## Third Party Libraries

+ [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) (includes OkHttp and Retrofit)

  Retrofit is designed to establish and perform requests to CoolClimate API web service.
  
+ [Stetho](https://github.com/facebook/stetho/blob/master/README.md)

  Stetho is a developmental tool that examines the local display resources and database contents.

## External Services

This app accesses the CoolClimate API carbon footprint calculator from the CoolClimate Network.

## Potential Future of GreenPrint

As this application progresses in development, the focus will start to implement a community based functionality. Users will be able to make a user profile, connect with friends and share. User will be able to receive helpful tips to decrease their footprint, as well as, getting kudos for each time they update their footprint in the form of enviormental equivalencies saved; e.i. amount of trees saved or amount of plastic bottles removed from ciculation per volume of carbon output decreased.

### Goals

+ Main User Profile: upload photo of username, summary, and initial carbon footprint score.
+ Notification Capable: Push notifications to friends to show progress.
+ Maybe be accessible to make a local community to increase environmental awareness.
+ Tips: User can receive tips on what they can do to decrease carbon footprint
+ Fun facts that give them knowledge of what effects decreasing their foot print has on the environment.

### User Interface Improvements

+ Use Google Sign-in API 
+ Improvement of GreenPrint logo
+ Use of images as background
+ History fragment that displays dates updated and score

## Instructions for Building GreenPrint

1. Clone the repository into a local Android Studio or perfered IDE project.

2. Get a [CoolClimate API Key](https://coolclimate.org/api)

3. Add active API key:

    to an internal directory-> name it service-> paste credentials (ID then key, on seperate lines)-> save as (.properties)
        
   (This is important so your key is not exposed to improper use and is needed to reference within the app)
   
4.Apply appropriate keys: [CoolClimate Variables](docs/CoolClimate_Variables.xlsx)

   (Use Postman to determine which keys and take actions you need.)
    
5. Build the app onto a device with the minimum of API 24.

## Instructions for Using GreenPrint

### On Startup

1. The Home screen will load upon starting the application.

2. The main navigation is through the side drawer, click the 3 horizontal in the upper left corner of the screen.

3. This will open the drawer menu to reveal other items to navigate to, Survey, Score, and History.

4. Click on the Survey option. 

The survey is a series of questions that ask the user about their yearly activities that produce varying ranges of carbon dioxide.

5. This brings up the initial survey to be filled out by the user -> answer the questions -> click "Submit" (at the bottom of the screen)
	
6. The Submit button will activate the API code and process the users carbon footprint score.

7. On submit, this will navigate to the Score screen (which is also accessible within the drawer menu).

### After Score is Obtained

1. The user should then click "Update Score", which will bring up a list of activities and tasks that will help the user lower their score throughout the year.

2. Once the user has completed a task, simply click the appropriate check-box.
(Currently option 7 is hard coded to as selected, until take action method is updated... TBD)

3. Click "Apply", which will subtract the take action options selected and return to the Score screen and apply the updated score.

4. Continue as needed until all tasks are complete. 

### The Start Of A New Year

1. At the beginning of a new year the user should retake the survey to start the process over.

2. The "Retake Survey" option is located  on the Score screen.

3. Click "Retake Survey", this will clear the previous score. 

4. Fill out the survey again and see your new score.

### History

1. The user can access their history of the previous scores.

2. Open drawer menu, click "History".

3. Upon navigation to the History screen, the user can view all of their scores.

### Survey FYI

The survey can be updated at anytime and as many times as the user sees fit. As the user becomes more aware of their carbon usage, they begin to hone in on more accurate estimations of usage.
